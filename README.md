# VendingKata
command line vending machine... phew... see: http://code.joejag.com/coding-dojo/vending-machine/

RUNNING IT:
You should be able to run this project via IntelliJ IDE or by running the projects MAIN in an any terminal.

USING IT:
when launched you'll be asked for a password.  
pro-tip: its "admin"... and it lets you access a few extra commands to edit core data.
Note: These are session only changes, so its not like you can end to program and come abck to see them!!
If you do not wish to be a superuser, you can just hit enter to continue, and follow the prompts to interact.

THOUGHTS:
This could stand to have the bank dealing portions refactored OUT of the main vending machine "controller".
This would probbaly pretty it up slightly, and maybe make it barely easilr to maintain.  
Another improvement is moving the data for the products and bank into a properties file or something similar.

PS:
For a Kata this thing was crazy, but it really made me think.  One day I will revisit this, but probably in ruby :P
