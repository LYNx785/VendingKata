# VendingKata
command line vending machine... phew... see: http://code.joejag.com/coding-dojo/vending-machine/

RUNNING IT:
Run this kata's MAIN file in an any terminal session.

USING IT:
when launched you'll be asked for a password, it's "admin"! It grants you access to extra commands that edit the core data.
If you do not wish to be an admin, hit enter to continue and follow the prompts.

THOUGHTS:
This could stand to have the bank portions refactored out of the main vending machine "controller", and see the product and bank data move into a properties file or something similar.
